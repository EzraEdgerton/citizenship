The average American today looks like any other person, no matter the hair color, height, weight, et cetera. Technically, everyone who has citizenship is American, but I believe that everyone who contributes to our nation is a real American. To me, an American represents someone who loves their country, and loves their community. Someone who gives back to their friends and family. Someone that is free and uses it for good. An American supports those around them, along with those who aren’t as privileged as us. I consider myself an accurate representation because im proud to be an American. I have different ethnicities in my blood, which makes me an American by culture. I love ‘murica.

My parents recently got their genomes sequenced. I can sum up my mom’s ancestry in one word: white. She was one hundred percent european, and not just european but northern european. You know the really pale ones, very little melanin? Her ancestors came over in the early to mid 1800’d like lots of other europeans at the time. They came seeking a better life. My dad on the other hand could be considered a human melting pot, with spices from all over the globe. Simply put, however, he’s half mexican. That's what people see, that's what our last name suggests. But that ignores the bit of african, ashkenazi jew, all the flavors of european, east asian and native American, and the neanderthal. I have one brown grandpa, he’s overweight, diabetic, and down to nine toes. He was born in indiana, and grew up in california in a spanish speaking home, and regularly ate grape leaves, not because they are fancy, but because they were free. He spoils his grandkids with treats and praise, is a huge baseball fan and is going to see the little league national championship next year. He’s also raised millions of dollars for universities, libraries, and has rubbed shoulders with lots of well-known people. But when people look at him, all they see is mexican. I also have one white grandpa - he was born in small time idaho, down the hill from where his dad was born. He was in the air force, and then worked for an accounting company for twenty two years, and is now retired with thirty grandchildren, plus a few great-grandchildren. He's a hard worker who spent most of my mother's childhood busy with serial church duties and business trips, so he wasn’t home a lot. He’s gruff, and intimidating to those who don't know him, but loves his family enough to get all fifty plus of his descendants together every other year for a big family reunion. And, he’s as my dad found out when asking for his blessing in my parents marriage, kinda racist. Growing up a part of these two very different families has been very interesting. I look very white, but have a really hispanic name, which results in a lot of weird looks and double takes when taking roll. I love mexican food, but i'm always down for a good old-fashioned barbeque. Being an American can mean a lot of different things, but one thing it has always meant to me is diversity. Both of my families are very different, but neither side seems better or worse, or more or less American.

An American can be anyone. Anyone who lives in america can be American, despite what many seem to believe. America is diverse, filled with many different people of different races, religions, ethnicities, and walks of life. Everyone here in america  has different experiences. Some have on sheltered versions of america, or their own creation. Others have lived all over the country, experiencing so much. Some American have lived in other countries. Some have never even been outside of the county. The term American doesn't have to include only those of the united states. America includes north and south america, meaning an American can be anyone from north, south or central america. Anyone one who lives from columbia, to canada, to cuba, is an American. Personally, I don't think the word American should mean only from the us. It’s sort of hogging the word American to mean only the us, when really all of north, south, and central america is all america. And anyone who lives in any of those places, is an American. But If you are using the word American, as to mean the usa, there is still a lot of diversity. There can be both immigrant and native citizens, of any race religion ,ethnicity, or creed. There are white Americans, african Americans, latin Americans, asian Americans, native Americans, there's about any kind of American you can kind of. America is very diverse.

There is no exact way to envision an American. This country is full of different people, and that is one of this countries main attributes. This is a place for everyone, so who is it possible to have one set way of thinking of an American. Everyone is so unique, and that is what is so great about this country. Its that everyone is welcome. There is a stereotypical American, but as previously stated, everyone is so different that the stereotype is no longer the norm. A white christian family is considered the typical American, but in many cases,  this is the exact opposite. You don't have to be white, and you don't have to be christian. No matter who you are or where you come from, you have a place in america. This country is a place for everyone, and it needs to stay that way.

Today america is powerful, free country. Americans on the other hand, aren't exactly the ideal model citizen. Of course, not every American is the same, but i feel the average American lacks creativity, isn't very healthy in diet or weight, and can tend to be very judgemental. Despite the fact that we live in a  free country, there is so much hate judgement and unhappiness. Even if i am an American, i strive to be happy, creative, open to new ideas, and uplifting.

Who is an American today? A modern American is someone who models their patriotism in their everyday life. They are hardworking, supporting others either financially, emotionally, or physically. An American is strong. They push through trials, facing what life throws with a brave face and a religious base. Today, a true American participates in extracurriculars. They volunteer at schools, in children's sport, and in the community. They work hard, and have busy schedules. They serve others daily, whether in the military, in deed, or in word. I know many people who represent Americans today. True Americans. My grandmother is one of them. She grew up in the early twentieth century, and learned from a  young age to love others and be kind. She eventually became a nurse, and has been involved in the community and LDS church ever since. Americans today are hardworking, loving people who strive to become better everyday.

A mask. People hide, they hide themselves. Masks are born out of insecurity. Insecurity is propagated by overwhelming stimulus, expectations, and a constant barrage of titles and opinions. We as Americans want to fit in. we want to hide, we wear the masks of political parties and social causes and whenever somebody says something that could affect our masks, take down our shields, we attack. We freak out. We over opinionate, and when others don't align with our opinions, we attack. Everyone postures that they are great that life is fine, that they are with a cause. But people fight for causes that aren't their own. All of this posturing and aggression makes us disingenuous, all because we expect others to be the exact same way. But when we look under the mask, when we see who people really are, we see humans, we see love. Under the mask of political opinions and aggression, we see beauty.

American to me, is a person who has different ethnicity, nobody is the same, we all have a story to tell. Yes we might not do as many things as we should in a day, or anything that we possibly could do in a day, but sometimes we are just so tired. Just so much going on in our lives, that is gets harder and harder every time. An American is a person who is caring, a person who doesn't really ask for help, and independent person, a person looking for better and newer opportunities everyday.  My parents came to the united states twenty five years ago. Going back and forth from mexico to the united states i was born in mexico, but raised in america. It doesn't matter where you are from or how you look, you could be an American just as anybody else. Be independent, be the person who you are meant to be. Live your life to the fullest, because that is what an American is.

We are all different, which is great, because we are all unique. Without diversity, life would be boring. Catherine pulsifer. I strongly believe that. In america, you see many different kinds of people. From african to australia, from a playful kid, to an American soldier. Our different backgrounds make what america is today. It may not be the best, but we have come a long way. Speaking of different cultures, i am micronesian. We micronesians originated from pohnpei. Off the pacific ocean. My parents grew up there, and then moved here because my dad was in the military. My dad being in the military, I was under the influence of a very prideful man. I understood at a young age what these men and women fought for. These servicemen take pride in their work for our country and our freedom. I am very thankful for that.

Who is an American today? An American today looks like any other person would. An American could either go to school or work. And works hard in whatever they do. An American is also a human that has a dream. The dream of graduating and pursuing their career. An American is also one who continues to grow, and to grow fast. An American represents an achiever and a fighter, a person who will do anything to get what they want, and to achieve their American dream. I see myself as an accurate representation of an American. My reason for this is because i am a student. I go to school, and im doing that to later pursue onto a job that would benefitted from my school, and that job will be my dream job. Americans are people who come together and unite.

An American today looks like someone who has pride in their country. We love celebrating the fourth of july, and we constantly sport the colors of red white and blue. Americans represent freedom. People from all over the world want to come to america because it represents freedom, safety, and opportunity. Because we have so many people coming here from all around the world, our population is amazing and diverse. I think i am an accurate representation of an American, but i also think everyone else is too. We are all Americans, and we all make up what america is today.

The first thought that comes to mind when asked who is American today can be characterized as well, confusion. Because at this point america is turning into a true salad bowl instead of a melting pot. There are so many different races, backgrounds, and cultures, and foreigners becoming American. So is the term American a tangible label that can be given? Looking around, you can never be sure who is an American, so the term American has taken on a separate meaning, other than just citizenship. To me, an American is someone who is always trying to progress intellectually, socially, politically, and physically. To build and grow for the better of self, and more importantly, the better of country. America is known for protests and going against the norms, in hope for reforming policies and the way of life, no matter how dumb we sound doing it. The bad ideas are seeded out, and america moves forward, for history moves through the conflict of ideas.

What is an American today/ for me there are two parts to this question. What should an American be and what an American is like today. It feels like there is a controversy surrounding this subject. First, and American should be a free, proud, strong human, they should be able to become who they want to be and given many opportunities to succeed. they should be happy they have the right to be free. Secondly, the way and American should be has been altered over the years. People are getting opportunities taken away from them, many Americans live in a state of fear. We’ve been taught that failure is bad, and are often afraid to speak our minds. Os what is an American today, what should an American be?

An American to me is someone who is proud of this country and proud to live here. It doesn't matter their race, religion, or political party, if they love and are willing to support america was a whole, that makes them American. They should be someone who believes in the freedom and liberty this country was created for. For equal rights for all, for equal opportunities. But most importantly, they just need to love america.

America is a great melting pot of cultures and people. I believe more and more, that people are biracial, and that should be celebrated. I also believe Americans should be accepting of people through all walks of life, which I strive to do. I’d probably be a good representation of said dynamic.

In today's society, and American has a terrible, bad repuation.to me, and American is represented by money. In america, money seems to be the only resource that separates one from another. Because of this, i see an American as a wealthy man, selfish and egocentric, especially with the man we call our president. Our president makes me feel less and less like an American. America itself is represented by freedom, justice, and self rights. Those rights are slowly being taken away from him. I personally do not see myself as an accurate representation of an American.

An American to me looks like someone knows how to speak english. Knows alot about the country the united states of america, puts their part in the country, and also shows respect for the flag by standing up and says the pledge. Around the community, especially 4th of july when the flag passes by, people hold their hand by their heart and also stand up. Also, when the military truck passes by, people show respect by standing up and clapping for them during prarades. At school for example every morning we say the pledge of allegiance, and show respect for the people who fought for our country. I see myself as an American because i was raised to always respect people who fight for our country. Also, i know a lot about back then with what happened at the war, and how people were treated. So i do see myself as an American and i am proud to be one.

I see Americans as people who try hard to please everyone. We try everything to make us be seen as beautiful, rich and powerful. We reveal more, buy more, and are less happy just to prove ourselves. I also see us as quite lazy. I mean we do invent things, but we eventually will get bigger and bigger. We also are addicted to our phones. As Americans we strive for a look that is ultimately not healthy and we don't accept ourselves for our differences and love ourselves for who we are. And i'm not saying all Americans are bad, i just pointing out the negatives. There are plenty of positives since there's so many people from different countries, were very kind and opening towards everyone. We can of course always improve, but there's always room to become better.

To be American is to have a dream, and to be able to make that dream come true. We have freedom, freedom to speak our mind, live our own lives, and fight for our beliefs. Being American is to be accepting, america is so diverse. You can walk downtown and see so many different cultures and traditions. Being American means that we are all treated equally no matter what color skin you have, and it doesn't matter what your culture is. At the end of the day, on matter divides us, whether is be religion, race, gender, sexuality, we are still going to work.

With all the crazy things happening in the world, people still show the best in humanity. Its natural for Americans to help and donate to those in need. We care for each other, and tits that single concept that makes people happy. Every single American is one hundred percent a result from immigrants. It's not something that should be oppressed or criminalized, but something that should be expressed and celebrated. My mom is an immigrant, and the people in our neighborhood have been changed by her, and in turn shes been changed by them. Americans have been through so much, and it's no accident that were where we are today. From the stunning mountains and brilliant seas, Americans will pursue and excel and we can only give credit to the amazing people that live here.

To me, everyone is an American. It doesn't matter where you come from, or where you're going. An American is proud, strong, and true. I've never really been out of the country, so for me, america is my whole world. I am so happy i am from this beautiful country. Lots of different people come to ind, and by that I mean lots of different personalities. We are all so different and diverse. We all have a different way of expressing what we feel on the inside. That being said, there are also people who try to be someone they aren't in order to feel accepted, but that can just be part of human nature. Every once in a while, I'll find someone, and everything about their being will make me so happy. I am an accurate representation of an American because i am me. I do my own thing, and let others do theirs. I am a lucky girl to have been born and raised here.

For the longest time, Americans or perhaps foreigners, have searched for an American dream. By creating their own story and having that sense of freedom an American to me is someone who want to achieve that dream no matter their nationality. America is a very diverse country, with everyone searching for their dream. I see this alot at school, especially now that i'm a senior. Seniors are at the point where we are deciding what we want to do with our lives, by picking colleges and planning our futures so that we can chase our American dreams. I see my friends and how motivated they are to become successful. My friends are Americans to me, even though all of them might not be actually be American, because i get to see how far they want to go in this life. I feel that i represent an American, because i too have an American dream. I want to change the lives of others, and i want people to see my potential and appreciate that, what i have to offer. I want to take art with me ,for the rest of my life, to reach that goal. I may only be half American by blood, but i know that i have an American dream.

An American could look like anything, america is a melting pot of everything like culture and races and ideas. An American could dress in any style or have any career, or hobby or religion, or anything. To me, america is diversity. People come here from all over the world and always have because it is the land of opportunity. Every different type of family and community can be found somewhere. I consider myself an American because to me, the only qualification to being an American is thinking of yourself as one.

En mal tiempo, buena cara. A phrase my parents lived by when they moved here. They had to, for their kids. We didn't have a lot growing up in the states, but they made their best efforts to give us a good childhood. They came here over twenty years ago, so my brothers and i mostly grew up American, but in a latino family, with latino traditions. Well celebrate American holidays like independence day, but well add our own twists like making tamales as a family. For birthdays, well have a barbeque of tacos and carne asada. But we do celebrate our native holidays and traditions, just as my parents did growing up. Living here has influenced a lot of factors in my life, more specifically, artistic ones. Music is a big part of who i am, and is a big inspiration to my art style. Im learning about American cultures and how they've mixed into mine, coming from a latino family.

Americans are diverse, we all come from different backgrounds or different ethnicities, different people, with different stories, with different dreams. From the beginning Americans were people who worked hard. Americans are people who get the job done without question. The founding fathers weren't perfect, but the principles that they penned and the ideals that they established shaped this nation and ultimately still guide this nation. We worked from the beginning, and we still are hard workers. We have the freedom to have dreams, and to share these ideas that can make a difference in the lives of many people. We have the ability to make the world around us better. Being an American today to me, means that i can choose what i want to do, and go forward with things that interest me and what i want to pursue. As Americans we have the chance to do something great. in a world where in many countries there are limited freedoms and limited opportunities, as Americans we are privileged to have all the opportunities that are available to us.

I think an American today is dependent on where you are, and how you look at it. The loudest is the white, middle aged, middle class man. Others are oppressed, silent under the words of the louder people, the rebellions gaining tractions only in word, but not in practice, and the rest of us are just trying to think.

So when we talk about what an American is today, we need to know what an American is, or what means to say that someone is an American. When you say that your American, you're referring to your nationality, not your ethnicity or race. So, someone that is born in the united states of america, would be considered, or at least would consider themselves an American. What exactly an American looks like today? Well, over the past decade, there's a lot more diversity added into the look of the American. We all know what the stereotypical look of an American is as like, foreign countries, but in america there's a lot more different types of people, you know, when it comes down to looks. there's a lot more different races, and there's a lot more mixed races inside america nowadays. For example when you ask someone what ethnicity or race they are, they would say something like im three fourths this, and one fourth that. It's never an exact “i am one hundred percent this,” anymore. Most importantly what an American is today, and what makes an American an American is the fact that they are more tolerant and accepting to differences. Especially when it comes down to race, and all that other stuff. Right, back then, well, let's talk about today. Today, if you told a kid back then that black people were discriminated and were thought of lesser or something like that, they would think it's very odd. Especially when you look at the sports channel and stuff. In fact you know, they would admire black people, because they dominate the sports things. So, the idea of you know racism and that, is kinda shunned upon today. While back then, a couple years ago, it was accepted, but now, it's a lot more different then, it's the exact opposite. And i think thats what makes an American an American, because compared to other countries they haven't had a lot of experience with a lot of different types of people, and diversity right? And so, thats what makes it - that's why in america, Americans have gotten used to all these different types of people, different religions, different ethnicities, different cultures, and all that stuff and you just kinda get along. Now of course we have some of those stories that, you know, it just - they don't actually, but the majority of Americans are tolerant and accepting. I think that's what makes an American, an American today.

I believe that Americans are people  who speak their minds and express themselves in any way they want to be shown. Americans have and I think will always protest against the things that they believe to be wrong. Many Americans today take for granted how much freedoms we have, an how great our freedom actually is. So many men and women have died for our generation, and hope for america’s future. I am filled with anger when people completely disrespect the country that gave them all these rights, that we have today.

When I think of an American, I think of someone who loves their country. Who knows the actual history, someone who is dedicated and passionate about America. In my family I see my mom as an American by the way she tears up just by singing the anthem. My family is extremely patriotic. I can just tell by the way they get excited and emotional about this country. I used to see myself as my representation of an American. Sure, I am, but lately I've been losing it. I used to want to join the Army and fight for this country, But now I refuse to join a military where transgender people are banned. The lgbtq community is so important to me, this country Is beginning to be filled with hate, and if that's what an American is, I want no part of it.

America is a society of people that tries to kill and bury people of color, People of different religions, different sexualities, and different identities, in order for the more dominant race to stay in power. America is a land of opportunity, if, you are a Caucasian man or a woman that has enough money. America is a country built on top of the bones of people the land originally belonged to, now forgotten and disrespected. America is a place where the minority are ostracized by past generations for not being how they were. America is where injustice only applies to innocent people to color, that only tried to help in a situation or had nothing to do with it in the first place.

An American today, is someone in the midst of change. Economically speaking, America has been changing constantly. Ever since the founding fathers America has been progressing and digressing in all subjects. People have been angry about that. People want constance, and with the economy in such a fluctuating state, they’re angry. I don't know a single American who isn't opinionated or angry about something. Everyone wants change, everyone thinks they have the best idea of what America should be. America and its ideas are constantly being pulled in a massive game of tug-of-war. I guess what I'm trying to point out is that everyone is angry. There are millions of opinions, and when one thing is changed to accommodate one group of people another group becomes angry. An American today is angry, opinionated, and pessimistic.

Danielle
An American today, is someone who embraces the differences within our society, and sees people for what they can become. Americans work hard for the benefit of others, whether it's their family, friends, or community. When I think of an American, the first thought that comes to mind is my mom and dad, who let me think freely, and encourage creativity. They work hard to ensure my safety and education, and someday I hope to do the same for my family. Another thought that comes to mind is the people who dedicate their careers to furthering and fostering the minds of our students. Besides parents and family, I'd say educators have the biggest influence on young minds of today. They represent the knowledge and determination that leads to camaraderie, advancement, and a hope for a bright future. Teachers foster our minds as well as our hearts, They show us how to respect and admire all characteristics of another personality, and in the process, teach us to love our differences. Even though I'm not a parent or an educator, I still think that I am an accurate representation of an American today. I fall, stumble, bleed, and sometimes I remind myself to be a little kinder. But I try to better myself everyday. Americans create and destroy, fail and triumph, and when we love and care, which is hopefully close to one hundred percent of the time, we do it with everything we have.

An American looks like a white cyst person that hasn't had to work for their achievements.  They woke up with wealth, and they will die with wealth. They're the selfish, cruel higher-ups that don't help minorities. They sit around while actual, hard working people hold up their status. You're told that cliches leave after high school, but then you're subjected to society's tiers of popularity. Everyone wants to be popular. Our government now consists mostly of people who have never been repressed or scared for their life, they don't know how it feels to be forgotten in healthcare, not able to marry, get killed because of their race, billionaires. Rich people who use their money for their advantage. They use their fame to get what they want. Diversity should be what America's actually about. However, the people who are always shown to be American are a straight white family, with their family that they raise with a christian-based religion. If you're not that in this country you don't fit in.

The average American today is unhelpful. It may not seem that way because of people with more of an extreme stance. Economically, socially, politically, or in education are usually The loudest. Your news is provided by Harvard graduates and their bachelors. You hardly ever interact with the grocery store employees or their customers. At your job, you probably work with a small crew of unhelpful people.  You may be tempted to think “wow it's pretty neat how most people are aiming for a high goal,” plot twist - behind the curtains of a sunny bowl of innocence you live in, with high walls made of doors, there's a swirling, writhing sea of nothing. It's black oil, a giant ocean of potential diesel fuel. People everywhere, most of the bungalows of every town, every city, people completely happy with exactly what they have. And why shouldn't they? In a philosophy based on their own feelings, there's no reason to help others. With nothing intense challenging, and no one to serve. What you do, if you don't want to go through the effort of getting a degree, you can build an unhealthy relationship with your couch. Or a person, or food. Or yourself.

I think an American today is not based on any race, gender, age, or nationality. I would never call anyone in my community not American because of how they looked, or where they came from. Um being an American is technically someone who lives in US, But really I think it's someone who believes in the certain ideals. Like Freedom, equality, progress, justice, and opportunity. I live in America, and I firmly believe those ideas, so I think that I am an American. Though, sometimes I feel almost ashamed of being an American and that is when I'm forgetting the beautiful core values that it was built on. We have a lot of not so good things going on that distract From those, but they're still there generally being upheld, and I think that's something to be proud of, and something to seek after. That is why people immigrate to America, and why I believe they're Americans as soon as they get here. They uphold and hope for these ideas, and that makes them American in my book. Um, the people look no one way but represent freedom, equality, progress, justice, opportunity, and my own, strongly suggested addition of love.

America is comprised of many different people. We're kind of a mosaic of different people with all of our unique and diverse interests, backgrounds, and morals. But something that we have in common is that we come from places in our past where we have struggled for this pursuit of freedom and liberty for everyone to live their lives as they choose, and to be safe doing that. America is a place of free expression, political or religious or otherwise. In some ways, this still rings true but I think that there's an element today of some peoples voices being stifled. There's a real sense of individuality with being an American. Americans in general are proud of their country, and aren't afraid to show it with their outspoken personalities, and the way that they portray themselves on media and social platforms. American actors and artists are highly influential on the rest of the world.

Rachel
America was built on the founding fathers willingness to act, rather than be acted upon. In fact, the freedoms that we are blessed with is not only a god-given right , but an utmost obligation. An obligation to stand up for ourselves, an obligation to do the hard things. A true American takes their destiny into their own hands, relying on no one to help them succeed. A true American is one who seeks truth and acts upon it, even if it costs them their life. Freedom isn't what makes America the country that it is today. It's the people who use that freedom to do amazing things that puts us where we are, and it is our duty to uphold the American tradition, and not only leave our legacy, but make it.
